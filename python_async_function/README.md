## Description
The projects in this directory explore the fundamentals of asynchronous programming in Python. Topics include:
- Understanding `async` and `await` keywords.
- Using `asyncio` for asynchronous tasks.
- Managing concurrency and parallelism.
- Writing efficient and non-blocking code.

## Technologies
- Python 3.8+
- `asyncio` library
- Ubuntu 20.04 LTS (development environment)

## Setup
1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/python_async_function.git
    ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd python_async_function
    ```
3. Ensure you have Python 3.8 or higher installed:
    ```bash
    python3 --version
    ```

## Usage
Run the Python scripts to explore asynchronous programming concepts:
```bash
python3 script_name.py
```
Replace `script_name.py` with the name of the file you want to execute.
