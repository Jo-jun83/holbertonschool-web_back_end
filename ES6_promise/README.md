## Description
The ES6 Promise project explores the concept of Promises, which are used to handle asynchronous operations in JavaScript. This includes creating, chaining, and handling errors with Promises. The project also covers practical use cases such as fetching data and managing asynchronous workflows.

## Learning Objectives
By completing this project, you will:
- Understand the concept of Promises in JavaScript.
- Learn how to create and resolve Promises.
- Chain multiple Promises for sequential execution.
- Handle errors effectively in asynchronous operations.
- Use Promises in real-world scenarios.

## Installation
To get started, clone this repository to your local machine:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/ES6_promise.git
```
Navigate to the project directory:
```bash
cd ES6_promise
```
Install the required dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

## Usage
Run the JavaScript files to test the implementation of Promises:
```bash
node <filename>.js
```
Replace `<filename>` with the name of the file you want to execute.
