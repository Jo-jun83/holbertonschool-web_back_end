## Description
The projects in this directory explore the use of type annotations in Python. Topics include:
- Basic type annotations for variables and functions.
- Using built-in types like `int`, `float`, `str`, and `bool`.
- Working with more advanced types such as `List`, `Tuple`, `Dict`, and `Callable`.
- Understanding `Optional` and `Union` for handling multiple types.
- Leveraging type annotations to improve code quality and maintainability.

## Technologies
- Python 3.8+
- Typing module for type annotations.

## Requirements
- A working installation of Python 3.8 or higher.
- Familiarity with Python programming basics.

## Usage
1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
