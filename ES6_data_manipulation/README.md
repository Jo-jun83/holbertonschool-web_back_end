## Description
The projects in this repository are designed to teach and practice efficient data manipulation using ES6 syntax and features. Topics covered include:
- Array methods (`map`, `filter`, `reduce`, etc.)
- Object manipulation
- Iterators and generators
- Working with sets and maps
- Advanced destructuring

## Technologies
- JavaScript (ES6)
- Node.js (for testing and execution)

## Projects
1. **Array Manipulation**: Exercises on using array methods effectively.
2. **Object Operations**: Working with objects, including merging, cloning, and destructuring.
3. **Iterators and Generators**: Understanding and implementing custom iterators and generators.
4. **Sets and Maps**: Using ES6 `Set` and `Map` for data storage and retrieval.
5. **Advanced Techniques**: Combining multiple ES6 features for complex data manipulation.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/ES6_data_manipulation.git
    ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd ES6_data_manipulation
    ```
3. Install dependencies (if any):
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

## Usage
Run the JavaScript files using Node.js:
```bash
node <filename>.js
```
Replace `<filename>` with the name of the file you want to execute.
